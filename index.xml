      <description>Human Factors Accident Classification System (HFACS) for Cybersecurity HFACS-Cyber is the world&amp;rsquo;s first application of the US Navy&amp;rsquo;s HFACS Framework to the cybersecurity domain to reduce incident recurrence
The Reason Model of Human Factors Dr James Reason developed the &amp;ldquo;cumulative act effect&amp;rdquo; (or the &amp;ldquo;Swiss-cheese&amp;rdquo;) model of incident causation. It takes a systems approach to incident investigations where the human is at the end of a chain of barriers meant to prevent unwanted events. This means that people are not the cause of incidents, but rather a factor in the system as a whole meant to prevent incidents.</description>
